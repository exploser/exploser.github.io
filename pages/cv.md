## Hobbies & interests
### Passionate hobbyist developer
I write code for all sorts of stuff, without considering whether it would be useful for anything at all.
Some examples of things I wrote:

- a primitive operating system in MASM
- a formula parser for university studies
- a Monkey programming language parser & interpreter (following "Writing An Interpreter In Go" book by Thorsten Ball, interpreterbook.com)
- a Minecraft-like voxel rendering engine/game (a 3D game in Go!)
- a pseudo-3D (Duke Nukem 3D, Doom 1 style) game with support for non-euclidean level geometry that runs on an ESP32
- a Bell 202 modulator/demodulator that runs on an Arduino (makes the old-fashioned modem sounds)
- software for an APRS (Bell 202 + AX.25) ham radio weather station

### Electronics enthusiast
I like building cool things from electronic components that, again, don't aim to be useful. 
Some examples of things I built:

- a schedule-based camera with live YouTube streaming for watching my pet cockatiel
- a Bell 202 AX.25 serial sound modem
- an APRS ham radio weather station powered by an Arduino and a pocket radio
- an Atmega programmer powered by an Arduino
- multiple simple AM and FM radio receivers
- an FM radio transmitter
- a flower watering system with humidity sensor, Wi-Fi and remote web access powered by an ESP-32
- a simplistic WAV player powered by an Arduino
- a beeping thingy for my washing machine, to let everyone know that the washing cycle has finished or that user input (adding fabric softener) is required

### Less nerdy activities
I also like to play videogames, cook, occasionally play guitar and bass and write music.
